            **** Rest API ****


1. Representational State Transfer (REST): REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
    - All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request. 
    - Working: A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back 
     from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON.
    - Get: HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST). 
    - Post: http response code is 201 with url to the newly-created resource.
    - Delete: HTTP response code of 200 (OK) on successfull deletion.

2. Any REST request includes four essential parts: an HTTP method, an endpoint, headers, and a body.
    - An endpoint contains a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) indicating where and how to find the resource on the Internet. 
     The most common type of URI is a Unique Resource Location (URL), serving as a complete web address.
    - Headers store information relevant to both the client and server. Mainly, headers provide authentication data â€” such as an API key,
     the name or IP address of the computer where the server is installed, and the information about the response format.
    - A body is used to convey additional information to the server. For instance, it may be a piece of data you want to add or replace.
