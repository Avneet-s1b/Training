Git

Git is a version control system that allows to keep track of changes made. It is helpful for collaborative work, prevent losses from crash, rolling back etc.

    • Diff. Between git and github: Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.

    • Distributed Version Control: What this means is that git doesnot consider any repo a central repo, all repos are equal and they are their own version of that particular project. Though we have one master in git it is not included by git we just decide to call that branch a master so it acts as a central base where everyone will submit their changes.

    • Configure git files: Git configuration can be done in three ways:
        1. System wide: git config --system 
        2. For particular user: git config --global
        3. For particular project: git config

	    To edit user name and email : git config --global user.name "Avneet-s1b"
						              git config --global user.email “email”

		To setup editor: git config --global core.editor “atom –wait”
		To setup ui: git config --global color.ui true
		
        To view any config info: 
            Command: git config user.name

            Example: 
                Username
                Command: git config user.name
                Result: Avneet-s1b

                email 
                Command: git config user.email
                Result: avneet.bhatia@berylsystems.com

                editor
                Command: git config core.editor
                Result: nano

		We can also view .gitconfig folder using cat.
            Command: cat .gitconfig 
            Result: [user]
                        name = Avneet-s1b
                        email = avneet.bhatia@berylsystems.com
                    [core]
                        editor = nano
                    [color]
                        ui = true


    • For help :  git help
                  git help commandname
	              man git-commandname

    • Initialize a git repo: to initialize a git repo in a project go to the project directory and type git init.

    • Commit change: to commit chnages three steps are followed: make change, add change to repo, commit change.
              To add: git add filename 
              To commit: git commit -m “message”

            Example: 
                Command: git add .
                         git commit -m "Adds help command notes to GitNotes"
                
                Result: [main 5c42dea] Adds help command notes to GitNotes
                        1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)


    • Best practices for commit message:
            1. keep it short. (optionally followed by a blank line and then desc if req)
            2. use present tense, since it should tell the bug that this commit is going to fix.
            3. Add tracking id of the issue.
            4. Be clear and descriptive.


    • Git log: it is useful to check a repository’s history.
        Command: git log

        Example:
            Command: git log
            Result: commit 10d51a102940703f03d83899ac33c86f23e69ee3 (HEAD -> master)
                    Author: Avneet <avneet.bhatia@berylsystems.com>
                        Date:   Wed Oct 18 17:09:53 2023 +0530

                                Initial commit

            10d51a102940703f03d83899ac33c86f23e69ee3 => this no is the sha-1 value of the commit.
	
    Sha-1 value is generated using a check sum and this checksum is a value generated for each set of changes done. This checksum is then passed through a 	hashing algorithm.

	Sha-1 value’s checksum for each commit also contains hash value of prev commit so each commitis linked to previous similar to blockchain/.

	Options: 
		    Command: git log -n 5: useful to show most recent no of commits if commits are many.
            Result: commit 13d54feac85da466808faef58a3eecd7856172e8 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)

    • Multi line commit message:  to give multi line commit message just do : 
        git commit this will open nano editor automatically as it has been set by us to 
        get opened whenever a commit messg is req. Remember commit mssg are imp without 
        them there will be no commit.

                    This commit adds multi line commit example to notes and three tier architecture description too.




    Three Tree Architecture

					Repository(changes being tracked by git)
						|
					          v
					Staging area(changes about to be commited)
						|
					          v
					Working file(changes not being tracked by git)


    • Head pointer is used by git to tell the current position of where we are working.

    • git status: used to check status of the current project about what changes are being tracked and what not.

        Command: git status
        Example Outputs: If the changes have been made but not staged

        On branch master
        Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

                    second_file.txt
                    third_file.txt

        nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

        If the changes have been made and staged but not committed.

        On branch master
        Changes to be committed:
        (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

            new file:   second_file.txt
            new file:   third_file.txt

        If the changes have been staged and committed too.
        
        On branch master
	    nothing to commit, working tree clean

    • git checkout: this is used to bring back file from repo in case of file loss.
              Command: git checkout -- filename 

              Example: 
                Command: git checkout --
                Result: M	Git/GitNotes.txt
                        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
 	        
              This -- in checkout is used too tell checkout that dont go looking on any 
              other branch we have to fetch the file from this current branch only.

    • git reset: this command is used to unstage the change.(if the changes were made to some file after being staged then this will not change the current file in working dir this will only unstage the file and current file condition will prevail).
                      
                      Command: git reset head filename

                      Example: git reset HEAD
                      Result: Unstaged changes after reset:
                              M	  Git/GitNotes.txt


	          If we stage some file then make changes to it after then there will be two diff 
              versions of our file one in staging area one in curr working tree and obv there will be one in git repo.


    • git diff: used to compare the changes in file between working directory and staging area.
          Command: git diff

          Example: 
          Command: git diff 
          Result:   diff --git a/demo.txt b/demo.txt
                    index 525a42e..1b6d18f 100644
                    --- a/demo.txt

    • git diff --staged: used to compare changes between staging area and repo.
          Command: git diff --staged 

          Example: 
          Command: git diff --staged 
          Result:   diff --git a/demo.txt b/demo.txt

    • git diff --color-words: used to show only changes and that too side by side.

            Example: 
            Command: git diff --color-words
            Result: diff --git a/demo.txt b/demo.txt

    • git rm: used to stage changes after or while deleting a file (like git add does).
	
		Two situations are present in it: 
            1. When we delete file manually using gui. Then we need to stage chages so we use
            
            Command: git rm filename
            
            This will ensure that file is still present in the machine’s trash.
            2. When we delete using the cmd. It permanently deletes the file using unix delete.
            
            Command is same as above: git rm filename
            
            This also prevents the need of two steps first deleting then staging 
            automatically deletes and stages the change simultaneously.
            Also one imp note is it will delete permanently the file from 
            so use this is another copy is present somewhere else or if you 
            dont want the file.

            Example:
            Command: git rm file.txt
            Result:  rm 'file.txt'

                    on git status it shows

                    On branch main
                    Changes to be committed:
                    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

                            deleted:    file.txt

    • Move and rename: we can do this in two ways:
        1. Manual renaming then we first need to stage deleted file name(git rm) and then stage new filename (git add). 
           Then in the staging area git will understand that the deleted file and new file are same and actually rename has taken place.

           Example: After manual renaming status will show mssg like:
                        On branch main
                        Changes not staged for commit:
                        (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
                        (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

                                deleted:    demo.txt

                        Untracked files:
                        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

                                demo_renamed.txt

                    Then we write followin commands: git rm demo.txt
                                                     git add demo_renamed.txt
                                                     git status

                    Now the git status message will be: 
                    On branch main
                    Changes to be committed:
                    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

                            renamed:    demo.txt -> demo_renamed.txt                                

        2. Using git mv command: moving is similar to rename here. 
               Command : git mv first_file.txt newfile.txt
               this will automatically stage the rename.

                Example: git mv GitNotes.txt Git_Notes.txt
                Result: On branch main
                        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

                        Changes to be committed:
                        (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

                            renamed:    GitNotes.txt -> Git_Notes.txt

    • To directly commit without staging: this command directly commits without staging but if there is a newfile which has not been committed even once then it wont commit that particular file and we will have to put that new file to staging .
	
		Command: git commit -a 
				git commit -all

        Example: 
            Command: git commit -am "Adds terminal o/p of rename command to Git_notes.txt"
            Result: [main df6b91d] Adds terminal o/p of rename command to Git_notes.txt
                    1 file changed, 9 insertions(+)

    • git show: shows the changes made in a specific commit
              Command: git show [hash value initials > 5]

    • Atomic commits: it is imp to make atomic commit so that in future if we want one specific 
                      feature we can use it and similar category changes should be comitted together.

    • Amending a commit: Git doesnot allow us to amend past commits since amending any past commit 
                         will change that commit’s sha value and thus breaking the chain of all commits. 
                         But we can amend the previous commit since it is not the parent of any next commit 
                         till now.
          Command: git commit --amend -m “Amends the commit”
          Example: [main 6bbd472] Amends previous commit to add example in Git_Notes.txt
                    Date: Wed Oct 25 13:37:15 2023 +0530
                    1 file changed, 9 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)

    
    • Retrieving an old version: git doesnt allow getting back an old commit since bringing back an old version wont
                                 maintain data integrity as sha value will repeat. Best way to retrieve old version is 
                                 too convert it into a new commit change.

		Command: git checkout [Hash-value] --

        Example:
        Command: git checkout b94b68c --
        Result: Note: checking out 'b94b68c'.

                You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
                changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
                state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

                If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
                do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

                git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

                HEAD is now at b94b68c Adds mango to demo list

    • Going back to a commit: we can go back to a commit using two ways:
        1. In this we have accidentally made the commit of a file name A, now we want to revert the commit so we can do this by 
        Command: git reset HEAD~1

        Example:
        Command: git reset HEAD~1
        Result : (Head will now be at previous commit) 

                Unstaged changes after reset:
                M        demo.txt
            
            This will make the file again in staging area so that we can edit file 	
    		further and make one commit

        2.  In this we want to restore the previous version of a commit completely
                Command : git reset --hard HEAD~1 
                                or
                          git reset [hash] --hard

                Example: 
                Command: git reset --hard HEAD~2
                Result: HEAD is now at 93f3418 Renames demo_renamed.txt to demo.txt
            
            We have to be careful while using this command since once we return to
     		a particular commit stage we wont be able to go back in the future.
        

    • git revert: we can also go back to old stage using git revert
		
			Command: git revert HEAD~1
                            or 
                     git revert [hash]

            Example: 
            Command: git revert HEAD
            Result: [main b53a4f2] Revert "Adds cherry to list in demo.txt"
                    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 2 deletions(-)
