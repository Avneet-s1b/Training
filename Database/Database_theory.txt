    ER MODEL 
        - It is a high level data model based on a perception of a real world that consists of a collection of basic objects, called
        entities and of relationships among these objects.Graphical representation of ER Model is ER diagram, which acts as a blueprint of DB.

        - Entity: An Entity is aN object in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects.
                  It has two types: Strong(Can be uniquely identified.) and 
                                    weak entity (Canâ€™t be uniquely identified., depends on some other strong entity.)

        - Attributes: An entity is represented by a set of attributes.(properties)
                    Types:  - simple
                            - composite
                            - single valued
                            - multi valued
                            - derived

                    - An attribute takes a null value when an entity does not have a value for it.

        - Relationships: Association among two or more entities e.g., Person has vehicle.
                    Types:  - Strong Relationship, between two independent entities.
                            - Weak Relationship, between weak entity and its owner/strong entity.

                    Degree of relationship: 
                    - Unary: only one entity participates
                    - Binary: two entity participate.
                    - ternanry: more than two entities participate.

                    Relationship constraints
                    1. Mapping cardinality
                        - one to one 
                        - one to many 
                        - many to one 
                        - many to many 
 
                    2. Participation constraint
                        - total participation (one entity will always have relation with other entity)
                        - partial participation (entity may not always have a relation eg. bank customer to loan)

                    

        - Specialisation: Specialisation is splitting up the entity set into further sub entity sets on the basis of their functionalities,
                        specialities and features. e.g., Person entity set can be divided into customer, student, employee. Person is superclass and other specialised
                        entity sets are subclasses. because Certain attributes may only be applicable to a few entities of
                        the parent entity set.

        
        - Generalization: It is reverse of Specialisation. bottom up approach.
